	"content": "In this section we will learn what AWS Transit Gateway is and why we need this feature.\nAmazon VPC and VPC Peering Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is an isolated virtual network within the AWS Cloud. Amazon VPC is very similar to traditional networks, allows users to deploy servers, databases, and other computing resources.\nIn fact, there are many cases where we need to connect two or more VPCs to share resources and data between these networks. The simplest way to connect these networks is through the Internet connection, however this method has many potential security risks, is unreliable and does not guarantee performance.\nVPC Peering is a feature that allows connecting two or more Amazon VPCs together through AWS\u0026rsquo;s private network, do not use Internet connection. When using VPC Peering to connect 2 VPCs, the resources in one network can connect to resources in the remaining network via private IP addresses as if they were in the same network. While VPC Peering is an effective feature for connecting VPCs together, it also has some drawbacks. One of these is that it can be cumbersome to manage a large number of connections when connecting multiple VPCs. VPC Peering does not have a transitive property, meaning that if VPC A is peered with VPC B and VPC B is peered with VPC C, VPC A cannot connect to VPC C. Additionally, an Amazon VPC cannot be peered with too many other VPCs. When you need to connect multiple VPCs together, the routing configuration becomes very complex, difficult to manage and troubleshoot.\nAWS Transit Gateway AWS Transit Gateway is a powerful VPC feature that enables connecting multiple VPCs, VPN connections, and on-premises networks to a single gateway. It simplifies network configuration by eliminating peer connections between VPCs, instead connecting them to a central hub that acts as a network traffic router. Compared to VPC Peering, AWS Transit Gateway offers several advantages:\nEnhanced Performance: Transit Gateway delivers superior performance by leveraging a centralized routing mechanism, reducing the overhead associated with individual VPC peering connections. Simplified Management: It streamlines network management by eliminating the need to manage complex peering relationships between VPCs. Instead, all connections are managed through a single hub, providing a more unified and manageable network topology. Scalability: Transit Gateway is highly scalable, capable of handling a large number of VPCs and connections without compromising performance or manageability. This makes it ideal for large-scale, dynamic cloud environments. Improved Troubleshooting: Troubleshooting network issues becomes easier with Transit Gateway, as the centralized architecture provides a clear overview of network traffic and simplifies the identification of routing problems. Due to these advantages, AWS Transit Gateway has become a popular choice for large-scale cloud deployments with complex network requirements. It is particularly well-suited for organizations that need to interconnect multiple VPCs, VPN connections, and on-premises networks while maintaining high performance, manageability, and scalability. To effectively utilize Transit Gateway, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to understand the different scenarios involved:\nVPCs in the same AWS Account and region VPCs in the same AWS Account, different regions VPCs in different AWS Accounts, same region VPCs in different AWS Accounts, different regions By understanding these scenarios, you can effectively utilize AWS Transit Gateway to connect multiple VPCs across various configurations, simplifying network management and enhancing network performance for complex cloud deployments.\n"

	"content": "In this section, we will learn about the routing mechanism of AWS Transit Gateway.\nAWS Transit Gateway Attachment AWS Transit Gateway Attachment serves as a logical connection between a resource and AWS Transit Gateway. This resource can be a VPC, VPN connection, Direct Connect gateway, or other supported resource types. When a new Transit Gateway attachment is created, it gets associated with the default route table of that Transit Gateway. However, this behavior can be modified within the Transit Gateway configuration.\nEach AWS Transit Gateway attachment can only be associated with one route table. To associate the attachment with a new route table, the existing association must be deleted first. When working with AWS Transit Gateway, if you encounter an error while associating an attachment with a route table, check if the attachment is already associated with another route table.\nTypes of AWS Transit Gateway Attachments:\nVPC: Connects a VPC to Transit Gateway VPN: Connects a VPC connection to Transit Gateway Peering Connection: Connects two Transit Gateways together Connect: Connects an SD-WAN appliance or on-premises network to Transit Gateway This workshop will focus on two specific attachment types: VPC and Peering Connection.\nResources that can connect to Transit Gateway via attachment are shown in the figure below. Route table AWS Transit Gateway route table is a logical entity that holds a collection of routes (route) defining how to forward traffic between resources connected to Transit Gateway. When you create a new AWS Transit Gateway, a default route table is automatically generated. However, if you disable route table association and route propagation, AWS will not create this default route table. You can also create additional route tables for your AWS Transit Gateway.\nEach attachment can only be associated with one route table and propagate routes to one or more route tables.\nThis workshop will focus on two types of route tables: Transit Gateway route table and VPC route table.\nTransit Gateway route table: Manages traffic routing between VPCs, on-premises networks, and attachments connected to Transit Gateway. VPC route table: Manages traffic routing within the scope of a single VPC. Route table association Transit Gateway route table association establishes a mechanism for automatically propagating routes from a route table to associated attachments, ensuring that traffic finds its intended destination without manual intervention.\nEach attachment can only be associated with a single route table. A single route table can be associated with multiple attachments.\nWhen an attachment is associated with a routing table, the routes in that routing table are automatically propagated to this attachment. This means that the routes in the routing table will be used to direct incoming traffic and go to the resources connected to that attachment.\nExample: Connect a VPC and the On-Premises Network\nConsider VPC A connected to Transit Gateway via the VPC A attachment. Creating a custom Transit Gateway route table and associating it with the VPC A attachment allows you to define a route to an on-premises network (e.g., 10.2.0.0/16). This route is automatically propagated to the attachment, enabling resources in VPC A to connect to the on-premises network without explicit VPC-to-on-premises network routing configuration. While route propagation simplifies network management, AWS Transit Gateway Policy Table offers an advanced mechanism for filtering and controlling routes propagated to specific attachments. However, due to its complexity, this feature will not be covered in this workshop.\nRoute propagation Within the realm of AWS Transit Gateway, route propagation serves as a fundamental mechanism for automatically distributing routes from a route table to associated attachments. This process streamlines network management by eliminating the need for manual route configuration for every attachment.\nEach attachment (e.g. VPC, VPN, Direct Connect gateway) comes with routes that can be installed in one or more transit gateway route tables. When an attachment is propagated to a transit gateway route table, these routes are installed in the route table.\nExample: Connect two VPCs\nConsider VPC A and VPC B connected to Transit Gateway through their respective attachments. Creating a custom Transit Gateway route table and associating it with the VPC A attachment. Then you create propagation between VPC B attachment and this route table. The following route will automatically be added to the route table.\nDestination Target Route type VPC B CIDR Attachment ID for VPC B Propagated The newly added route will be propagated to VPC A attachment because it is already associated with this route table, this configuration allows VPC A to connect to VPC B through Transit Gateway. Route table association vs. Route propagation By understanding the concepts of route propagation and its implementation within AWS Transit Gateway attachments, you can effectively manage network traffic flow, simplify network configuration, and enhance the overall efficiency of your cloud infrastructure.\nThe key difference is that association determines which route table is used for a specific attachment, while propagation ensures the routes in that table are applied to the attachment, enabling connectivity between the connected resources.\nImagine a Transit Gateway as a vast library, each bookshelf representing a route table and each book representing a route. Route table association can be likened to granting an individual a library card, providing them with access to the books (routes) within the library (route table). Route propagation, on the other hand, is analogous to allowing the individual to borrow books, enabling them to utilize the resources (routes) for their intended purpose.\nExample: E-commerce system with microservices architecture\nConsider an e-commerce system employing a microservices architecture, comprising four services: Product, Order, Analyzer, and Visualizer. Each service plays a distinct role:\nProduct: Handles product-related requests Order: Manages purchase-related requests Analyzer: Analyzes product quantity, order volume, revenue, and other metrics Visualizer: Utilizes data from Analyzer to generate charts and graphs Each service is deployed in its corresponding VPC: Product VPC, Order VPC, Analyzer VPC, and Visualizer VPC. All VPCs are connected to the same AWS Transit Gateway using the respective attachments: Product Attachment, Order Attachment, Analyzer Attachment, and Visualizer Attachment. To enable communication between these VPCs, route configuration is essential.\nDue to the urgency of releasing the product to users, the Product and Order services are prioritized for initial release. The development of Analyzer and Visualizer follows. Since Analyzer is still under development and not yet ready for production, its connection to the released services is not immediate. Therefore, we will have two environments: production including two services Product, Order and non-production including two services Analyzer and Visualizer.\nWe need to configure the network as follows:\nProduct and Order services can be connected to each other Analyzer and Visualizer services can connect to each other Analyzer and Visualizer services cannot connect to Product and Order services Utilizing a single route table associated with all attachments is not recommended due to potential issues:\nSecurity Isolation: Linking all attachments to a single route table compromises security isolation between production and non-production environments. Different configuration requirements may exist between these environments, limiting flexibility. Unnecessary Propagation: Propagating routes from production VPCs to non-production VPCs is unnecessary as these VPCs do not require direct communication. This configuration adds complexity and potentially slows down routing between networks. To address these challenges, we can create two custom route tables:\nProductionRTB: Associated with Product Attachment and Order Attachment NonProductionRTB: Associated with Analyzer Attachment and Visualizer Attachment This approach effectively defines route tables for specific attachments and segregates configurations between production and non-production environments. The technique of using multiple route tables is widely employed in subsequent sections.\nOnce Analyzer is ready, it needs to connect to Product and Order for data analysis and revenue reporting. Visualizer only requires data from Analyzer, hence connecting Analyzer VPC to Product VPC and Order VPC suffices. This can be achieved by creating propagation between ProductionRTB and Analyzer Attachment. Consequently, a new route enabling traffic routing to Analyzer Attachment is automatically generated and propagated to Product and Order attachments. Routes for peering attachments Similar to VPC peering, AWS Transit Gateway enables the interconnection of two Transit Gateways, facilitating seamless communication between networks. To achieve this, a peering attachment is created within one Transit Gateway, specifying the peer Transit Gateway to establish the connection. Since peering attachments do not automatically propagate routes, manual configuration of static routes is required to direct traffic to the peered Transit Gateway. Once traffic reaches the peered Transit Gateway, it can be further routed to its connected attachments. "
